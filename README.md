CodeClauseInternship_Predicting-Employee-Attrition

Attrition is the silent killer that can switly disable even the most successful and stable of the organizations in a shockingly spare amount of time. Hiring new employees are extremely complex task that requires 
capital, time and skills.Also new employee costs a lot more than that Persons salary.

The cost of hiring an employee goes far beyond just paying for their salary to encompass recruiting, training, benefits, and more.
Small companies spent, on average, more than $1,500 on training, per employee, in 2019.
Integrating a new employee into the organization can also require time and expenditures.
It can take up to six months or more for a company to break even on its investment in a new hire.
The Cost of Hiring a New Employee is a lot more than that Persons salary.

In this project, I have developed a Machine Learning Model to predict the Employee Attrition by implementing various Machine Learning Algorithms. Conducted exploratory data analysis using various data visualization 
techniques.

Achieved good accuracy on the 'employee_attrition_kaggle' dataset from Kaggle,using Logistic Regression.

Dataset : Downloaded from kaggle website and attached above also. 

Purpose: The purpose of this project was to develop a model to predict the likelihood of employee attrition in a company.
Technologies Used: The project makes heavy use of Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, numpy and Seaborn libraries to visualize patterns, distributions and relationships in the Employee Attrition dataset.
